    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These fluffy pancakes are perfect for a leisurely breakfast or brunch. Made with simple ingredients like flour, eggs, milk, and a hint of vanilla, they're easy to whip up and sure to please everyone at the table.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; it's okay if there are lumps.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake.</li>
        <li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh berries, or whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
