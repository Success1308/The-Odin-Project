    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup warm water (110° to 115°)</li>
      <li>2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
      <li>1 can (8 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1-1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>
        Your favorite pizza toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers,
        onions)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand for 5
        minutes. In a large bowl, combine flour, oil, salt, garlic powder,
        oregano, basil, and pepper. Stir in yeast mixture. Turn onto a floured
        surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 2-3 minutes. Place in a
        greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a
        warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch dough down. Preheat oven to 425°. On a lightly floured surface,
        roll dough into a 12-in. circle. Transfer to a greased 12-in. pizza pan.
        Build up edges slightly. Spread with tomato sauce; sprinkle with cheese
        and your favorite toppings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake until crust is golden brown and cheese is melted, 15-20 minutes.
        Slice and serve.
      </li>
