      <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>16 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef, onion, and
        garlic until browned. Add the tomato sauce, tomato paste, crushed
        tomatoes, basil, salt, pepper, and parsley. Simmer for about 30 minutes,
        stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
        noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
        with cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, and remaining
        parsley.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble, spread 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch
        baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with
        one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella
        cheese. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with
        1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining
        mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking
        spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an
        additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
